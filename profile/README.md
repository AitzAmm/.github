AitzAmm is a branch of the Broke Consortium, also known as the Research, Provisions, Successors, and the Member of the Broke Consortium or the Broke Consortium of Mathematical Research. It operates as an open-source, unregistered not-for-profit research organization focused on computational and non-trivial mathematical fields.

As a non-exclusive branch of the Broke Consortium, AitzAmm upholds the principles of open-source access and the sharing of knowledge. This ensures that all activities and resources are openly accessible to anyone, including students from high schools associated with the consortium. AitzAmm is jointly run by Aitzaz Imtiaz and Syed Ammar for now, with the aim of developing mathematically efficient applications and computationally efficient solutions.

AitzAmm follows the following guidelines and principles:

- All projects and developments by AitzAmm do not adopt the "B License". This initiative is taken for less philosophical and more of copyright approach. You can align with B-Consortium instead for this purpose.
- Proper citation of the source is mandatory.
- AitzAmm is not liable for any damages resulting from the use of derived products.
- AitzAmm is neither a business nor a legal entity associated with companies. It is a philosophical association aimed at promoting societal well-being.

The products and research outcomes of AitzAmm are intended to contribute original and novel ideas to advance human knowledge. The consortium strives to identify and highlight ideas with genuine novelty, while discouraging those lacking originality.

AitzAmm ensures the following standards:

| Sr. | Standard Rules | Applied? |
|----|-----------------|----------|
| 1. | AitzAmm focuses on developing libraries, command-line interfaces (CLIs), and interfaces without relying on graphical interfaces. | :heavy_check_mark: |
| 2. | AitzAmm does not associate itself with any means of making money. It upholds the philosophy of promoting philanthropy and provides freedom to use its products. | :heavy_check_mark: |
| 3. | AitzAmm is comfortable to collaborate with unassociated entities to create joint projects. We welcomes issues, comments, PRs, and suggestions  for improvement from others unlike B-Consortium. This rule ensures that all external copyrights are respected while the consortium remains committed to its philanthropic mission. | :heavy_check_mark: |
| 4. | AitzAmm strictly determines whether a tool or project benefits humanity or not. It disallows the use or development of harmful tools or cyber weapons. Any such tools from the predecessor, BS Consortium, are classified as property of AitzAmm. Since its formation, AitzAmm refrains from engaging in any further cyber weapon development. | :heavy_check_mark: |

SR.4 of the basic standard rules in B-Consortium will not be taken in the basic standard rules of AitzAmm.

### Relations to other Branches of B Consortium
AitzAmm will not use any tool developed by NeuroStol Publishing, AitSad, B Consortium Central, Terminal Patriotism or any exclusive branch given member to the consortium. However, external tools and tools from any future non exclusive joining branch shall be utilized
