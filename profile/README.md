AitzAmm is a branch of the Broke Consortium, also known as the Research, Provisions, Successors, and the Member of the Broke Consortium or the Broke Consortium of Mathematical Research. It operates as an open-source, unregistered not-for-profit research organization focused on computational and non-trivial mathematical fields.

As a non-exclusive branch of the Broke Consortium, AitzAmm upholds the principles of open-source access and the sharing of knowledge. This ensures that all activities and resources are openly accessible to anyone, including students from high schools associated with the consortium. AitzAmm is jointly run by Aitzaz Imtiaz and Syed Ammar for now, with the aim of developing mathematically efficient applications and computationally efficient solutions.
